## 1. Only code quality matters
*Your person or any of its aspects are irrelevant*;
 - age
 - gender
 - sexual orientation
 - nationality
 - religion
 - personal views (on anything non-project-related)
 - physical or mental disabilities

*Who or what you are and what you do are also irrelevant;*
 - a company, corporation, business
 - artificial intelligence
 - extraterrestrial:
   - entity
   - life
   - species

## 2. No-drama & no-nonsense policy
*Constructive and rational discussions. Topics unrelated to coding of, or the project itself, such as but not limited to:*
 - insults
 - personal critique
 - politics
 - CoC ranting
 - social (in)justice

*must take place elsewhere.*

## 3. Absolutely everyone, without any exceptions whatsoever, is treated equally and respectfully
*Even if you're:*
 - violating this Code of Conduct
 - Jesus and just fixed all zero-days
 - Mr. Torvalds himself
 - a newbie who's just made their first ever commit, no matter of what quality
